A knowledge base for UoL course "Programming for Data Science"

## General recommendations

* Be specific, brief and informative
* Do not forget about links between concepts from the same or different clusters
* Code snippets should be short, just in a few lines
* For larger code examples in Python use Jupyter Notebooks, for R use R Markdown
* Use markdown files for large pieces of non-programming content
