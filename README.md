# ST2195
A knowledge base for UoL course "Programming for Data Science"

## General recommendations

* The main goal is to create a handful tool which allow you and your mates (and maybe even the future generations of student) to prepare for the exam.
* It's quite unlikely that you'll manage to build a good knowledge base on the first try. The more iterations you do, the better resuld you get.

### Miro

* Be specific, brief and informative
* There is enough space in Miro, keep distance between elements large enough
* Color opacity and size could point to position of a concept in the hierarchy
* Think about links with different meaning, denote them with specific arrows or hyperlinks
* Do not forget about links between concepts from the same or different clusters
* Code snippets should be short, just in a few lines
* Every concept or function should be provided with characteristic examples
* Some functions have lots of parameters, try to figure out the most important ones

### Github

* All long pieces of text or code should be stored in Github, not in Miro
* Create a branch named after your topic and commit all the stuff into that branch
* For larger code examples in Python use Jupyter Notebooks, for R use R Markdown
* Use markdown files for large pieces of non-programming content

### Deadlines

* -1 point per each week of delay
* +1 point if you are ready before your deadline
