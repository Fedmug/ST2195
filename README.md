A knowledge base for UoL course "Programming for Data Science"

## General recommendations

### Miro

* Be specific, brief and informative
* There is enough space in Miro, keep distance between elements large enough
* Color opacity and size could point to position of a concept in the hierarchy
* Think about links with different meaning, denote them with specific arrows or hyperlinks
* Do not forget about links between concepts from the same or different clusters
* Code snippets should be short, just in a few lines
* Every concept or function should be provided with characteristic examples
* Some functions have lots of parameters, try to figure out the most important ones

### Github

* Create a branch named after your topic and commit all the stuff into that branch
* For larger code examples in Python use Jupyter Notebooks, for R use R Markdown
* Use markdown files for large pieces of non-programming content
