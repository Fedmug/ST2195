# My first R Markdown file

After a hard training day with Yoda, I decided to author my first [R
Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file. This is a text chunk
written in *Markdown syntax*. I can write **bold** and *italic*, and
even record quotes I want to remember like

> *Do. Or do not. There is no try*
>
> Yoda, The Empire Strikes Back

I can also ask R to run code and return the result. For example, I can
ask R to print the quote

```{r quote}
print("Do. Or do not. There is no try")
```

I can also do complex arithmetic. For example, if your R installation
could do infinite arithmetic you could see that `1/81` has all single
digits numbers from 0 to 9 repeating in its decimal, except 8!

```{r arithmetic}
print(1/81, 15)
```
