      "• Through the default R GUI (on Window and macOS) —simple and effective \n",
      "• Through RStudio—powerful and widely used  \n",
      "Another way popular developers and scientists is through the Emacs Speaks Statistics  (ESS) \n",

      "you are familiar with Emacs , but we will not cover it here.  \n",

      "Before we continue with the various ways of using R, we need to know how we can—slightly informally put —give names to the results of an operation for further manipulation later. \n",

      "the right of <- using floating point arithmetic , store the result in computer memory and then \n",
      "bind it to the name a on the left of <-. For example, we can then do  \n",
      "print(a, 15) \n",
      "[1] 8.0000000729 \n",
      "to print the value bound to a in 15 significant digits. \n",
      "The symbol <- (less and a dash) is R’s assignment operator . Another common convention \n",
      "in recent versions of R is to use = for assignment (as in Python and other  programming \n",
      "languages). That’s OK but <- is formally more valid because i) it highlights the direction of \n",
      "assignment, and ii) formally a and 987654321/123456789  are not really equal (by definition \n",
